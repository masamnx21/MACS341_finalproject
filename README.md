The code loads in the example data (name hard-coded in), make sure that both files are in the same directory.

The first couple of cells contain package imports, variable definitions, and functions. You will only have to interact with the last two cells; however, make sure to run all previous cells so that everything is defined.

The code opens a window to run a GUI. To continue past this point, close the window. The code will not advance with the window open.
